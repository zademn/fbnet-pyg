# fbnet-pyg

fbnet reimplemented in Pytorch Geometric. Started from the [original repo](https://github.com/hikvision-research/3DVision/tree/main/PointCompletion/FBNet) and reimplemented most of in in Pytorch Geometric.

This was done as part of a course where we had to reproduce some sota research. I did it as pyg practice and to understand it.
