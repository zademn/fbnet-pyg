# FBNET-pyg

FBNET reimplemented in Pytorch Geometric. Started from the [original repo](https://github.com/hikvision-research/3DVision/tree/main/PointCompletion/FBNet) and reimplemented most of it in Pytorch Geometric.

This was done as part of a course where we had to reproduce some sota research. I did it as pyg practice and to understand it.

- [Chamfer distance repo](https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/ChamferDistancePytorch)
- `FBNET.py` was taken from the official repo

Relevant libs:
```
pytorch 1.13
pytorch_geometric 2.2
einops
```
